# TruthAI

**TruthAI** is an open-source initiative to create a 100+ billion parameter language model focused on **factual accuracy**, **logical consistency**, and **transparent development**.

## 🌟 Vision

TruthAI is built with one mission: **raise the intelligence and factual grounding of LLMs**.

Too many models generate confident misinformation or opaque outputs. We aim to change that by creating a foundation model that is:

- 📚 Trained on *verifiable, curated data*
- 🔍 Auditable by the public
- 🧠 Designed for *high reasoning ability* and truthfulness
